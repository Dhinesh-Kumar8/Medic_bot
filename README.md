### Sharing Your Demo

What good is a beautiful demo if you can't share it? Gradio lets you easily share a machine learning demo without having to worry about the hassle of hosting on a web server. Simply set `share=True` in `launch()`, and a publicly accessible URL will be created for your demo. Let's revisit our example demo,  but change the last line as follows:

```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
   global messages
   health_condition = gr.Dropdown(["BP","FEVER","TYROIDE","SUGAR"],label = "health_condition")
   severity_condition = gr.Dropdown(["minor","moderate","major","extreme"],label = "severity_condition")
   chatbot = gr.Chatbot()
   msg = gr.Textbox()
   clear = gr.Button("Clear")
    
demo.launch(share=True)  # Share your demo with just 1 extra parameter ðŸš€
```

When you run this code, a public URL will be generated for your demo in a matter of seconds, something like:

ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; `https://a23dsf231adb.gradio.live`

Now, anyone around the world can try your Gradio demo from their browser, while the machine learning model and all computation continues to run locally on your computer.

### An Overview of Gradio

So far, we've been discussing the `Interface` class, which is a high-level class that lets to build demos quickly with Gradio. But what else does Gradio do?

#### Chatbots with `gr.ChatInterface`

Gradio includes another high-level class, `gr.ChatInterface`, which is specifically designed to create Chatbot UIs. Similar to `Interface`, you supply a function and Gradio creates a fully working Chatbot UI. If you're interested in creating a chatbot, you can jump straight [our dedicated guide on `gr.ChatInterface`](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast).
